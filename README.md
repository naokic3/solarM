# Solar Index Insurance
## Reducing basis risk

The sun offers an inexhaustible source of clean energy, yet the world relies on fossil fuels for over 80% of its energy needs â€“ at great environmental and economic cost.

The goal of this project is to develop an open-source framework for end-to-end analysis of the design and pricing of location and
system-specific solar power option contracts. A primary step in this process is to understand and model the stochastic properties of solar panel output in order to design and price index based insurance.  I explore a classical and bayesian time series models.
