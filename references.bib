  abstract = {This article presents a low-cost insurance system developed for smallholder farms in disaster-prone regions, primarily using free Earth observation (EO) data and free open source software’s (FOSS), collectively termed “sustainable geoinformatics.” The study examined 30 farms in Risaralda Department, Colombia. A digital elevation model (12.5 m pixels) from the ALOS PALSAR satellite sensor was used with a geographic information system (GIS) to map the terrain, drainage, and geohazards of each farming district. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to carry out time-series analysis of 15 EO and weather datasets for 1998 to 2020. This analysis enabled the levels of risk from hydrometeorological hazards to be determined for each farm of the study, providing key data for the setting of insurance premiums. A parametric insurance product was developed using a proprietary mobile phone app that collected GPS-tagged, time-stamped mobile phone photos to verify crop damage, with further verification of crop health also provided by daily near-real-time satellite imagery (e.g., PlanetScope with 3 m pixels). Machine learning was used for feature identification with the photos and the satellite imagery. Key features of this insurance system are its low operational cost and rapid damage verification relative to conventional approaches to farm insurance. This relatively fast, low-cost, and affordable approach to insurance for small-scale farming enhances sustainable development by enabling policyholder farmers to recover more quickly from disasters.},

  abstract = {For large energy consumers transitioning to high shares of solar energy, irradiance variability causes volatility in power generation and energy expenditures. Volatility in an end user’s cash flow is harmful to their financial health, especially in abnormally cloudy years. This paper explores the utility of an irradiance-based weather derivative in mitigating cloud weather risk and measures the effectiveness of the developed derivative by applying it to a case study of two Chilean copper mines. Weather derivatives are financial instruments tied to an underlying weather variable that act as an insurance for the contract holder, executing indemnity payments based on an index value. This research develops a contract with a combined index based on monthly sums of irradiance and cloudy day sequencing to mitigate a solar mine’s weather risk. The design and evaluation of contracts are based on LEELO, a linear optimization model outputting optimal sizes of solar photovoltaic, battery storage, and power-to-gas systems, as well as the operation of these systems for a given mine’s load, irradiance and technology costs. Results indicate contracts are effective in cloudier climates with increasing utility for mines installing solar energy systems until the year 2030. After 2030 batteries begin to become a more cost-effective risk-hedging mechanism as they become more affordable.},

  abstract = {With uninsured risk representing a major hurdle to investment, productivity growth, and poverty reduction in developing country smallholder agriculture, index-based agricultural insurance has offered the promise of overcoming the hurdles of traditional indemnity-based insurance for this context. In spite of extensive experimentation, take-up has been disappointingly low without large and sustained subsidies. We show that existing constraints on take-up can partially be overcome using revised contract designs, advanced technology for better measurement, improved marketing, and better policy support. However, because index insurance is likely to remain expensive in that context, we suggest that improved index insurance be combined with stress tolerant seed varieties and new risk-oriented savings and credit products that build on the complementarities between what can be offered by index insurance and these other instruments to cope with shocks and manage risk.},

This paper proposes a methodology that uses machine learning algorithms for the identification of extreme flood and drought events aimed at reducing the basis risk connected to this kind of insurance mechanism. The model types selected for this study were the neural network and the support vector machine, vastly adopted for classification problems, which were built exploring thousands of possible configurations based on the combination of different model parameters. The models were developed and tested in the Dominican Republic context, based on data from multiple sources covering a time period between 2000 and 2019. Using rainfall and soil moisture data, the machine learning algorithms provided a strong improvement when compared to logistic regression models, used as a baseline for both hazards. Furthermore, increasing the amount of information provided during the training of the models proved to be beneficial to the performances, increasing their classification accuracy and confirming the ability of these algorithms to exploit big data and their potential for application within index insurance products.},

This study creates a hybrid methodology to improve the accuracy of short-term power prediction forecasts using a model called Transformer Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory). This model, which combines elements from the transformer architecture and bidirectional LSTM (Long–Short-Term Memory), is evaluated using two strategies: the first strategy makes a direct prediction using meteorological data, while the second employs a chain of deep learning models based on transfer learning, thus simulating the traditional physical chain model. The proposed approach improves performance and allows you to incorporate physical models to refine forecasts. The results outperform existing methods on metrics such as mean absolute error, specifically by around 24\%, which could positively impact power grid operation and solar adoption.},

  abstract = {Understanding the resilience of photovoltaic (PV) systems to extreme weather, such as heatwaves, is crucial for advancing sustainable energy solutions. Although previous studies have often focused on forecasting PV power output or assessing the impact of geographical variations, the dynamic response of PV power outputs to extreme climate events still remains highly uncertain. Utilizing the PV power data and meteorological parameters recorded at 15 min intervals from 1 July 2018 to 13 June 2019 in Hebei Province, this study investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of the PV power output and its response to heatwaves. Solar radiation and air temperature are pivotal in enhancing PV power output by approximately 30\% during heatwave episodes, highlighting the significant contribution of PV systems to energy supplies under extreme climate conditions. Furthermore, this study systematically evaluates the performance of Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models under both summer heatwave and non-heatwave conditions. The findings indicate that the RF and LightGBM models exhibit higher predictive accuracy and relative stability under heatwave conditions, with an R2 exceeding 0.98, with both an RMSE and MAE below 0.47 MW and 0.24 MW, respectively. This work not only reveals the potential of machine learning to enhance our understanding of climate–energy interplay but also contributes valuable insights for the formulation of adaptive strategies, which are critical for advancing sustainable energy solutions in the face of climate change.},

This article updates previous reviews on agricultural insurance but differs in that it goes beyond the prognosis that recent innovations can help make insurance more commercially viable. As such, it addresses two important challenges that have received limited attention. First, it distinguishes different types of farm households and recognizes that many are excluded from the insurance market, describing additional innovations that can help make insurance more accessible to these excluded groups. Second, it acknowledges that insurance for catastrophic risks is unaffordable for most farmers and summarizes new developments in disaster assistance and safety net programs that can provide broader protection against these risks. The review concludes that cost-benefit analyses of subsidized insurance programs will be crucial for guiding public spending decisions.},

This study aims to design index‐based insurance to manage the volatility risk of solar radiation on energy production. We apply auto‐regressive integrated moving average~models to predict monthly and annual energy production for a solar PV power plant in Taiwan and use the estimated results to calculate the pure premium rates for the designed insurance product. The daily data on solar irradiation are from NASA surface meteorology and solar energy, spanning 35\,years from January 1984 to December 2018. The analyzed results reveal that the index‐based insurance approach can protect against the impact of insufficient solar radiation on solar PV energy production to strengthen investment security for solar PV projects.},

This paper addresses the low prediction accuracy stemming from the inability of existing methods to thoroughly analyze temporal information. It introduces a GRU-Transformer model that combines the Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Transformer for enhanced short-term PV power prediction. The model initiates with a correlation analysis to identify significant factors influencing PV power generation and integrates various conditions affecting PV output into a unified embedding. To improve the prediction accuracy, the model adopts a dual-layer architecture. The initial layer employs GRU’s gated units to distill essential temporal features from the data sequence. The subsequent layer utilizes the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to discern global information and contextual interrelations within the temporal data, pinpointing pivotal features for the current timeframe. This process refines the sequence data and augments the model’s representational ability, leading to precise short-term PV power forecasts.

The effectiveness of the direct approach is assessed through a case study of the Bichurskaya PV power plant, utilizing a supervised machine learning model, specifically the MLP model. Data from two grid-connected PV power plants, based on PVOD data, is used to evaluate the performance of the indirect approach, which involves sequential mathematical modeling of PV plant components using models from the pvlib library. Results indicate that, with sufficient input data, the direct approach is able to surpass traditional mathematical modelling in PV plant output power estimation. The MLP model achieved an nRMSE metric of 3.3\%, while the model chain demonstrated a 5.3\% performance on the same dataset.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the efficacy of weather derivatives as a risk management tool in the agricultural sector of Naousa, Greece, focusing on tree crops sensitive to temperature variations. The specific purpose is to assess how effectively weather derivative options can mitigate financial risks for farmers by providing strategic solutions. The study assesses the strategic application of Heating Degree Days (HDD) index options and their potential to alleviate economic vulnerabilities faced by farmers due to temperatures fluctuations. Employing different strike prices in Long Call and Straddle options strategies on the HDD index, the research offers tailored risk management solutions that cater to varying risk aversions among farmers. Moreover, the study applies the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to quantify the financial security that weather derivatives can furnish, revealing a significantly reduced probability of severe financial losses in hedged scenarios compared to no-hedge conditions. Results show that all implemented strategies effectively enhance financial outcomes compared to scenarios without hedging, highlighting the exceptional utility of weather derivatives as risk management tools in the agricultural sector. Strategy 4, which exhibits the lowest VaR, emerges as the most effective, providing substantial protection against adverse weather conditions. This research supports the notion that weather derivatives can substantially contribute to the economic sustainability of rural economies, influencing policy decisions toward enhancing financial instruments for risk management in agriculture.},

  abstract = {Large-scale solar energy production is still a great deal of obstruction due to the unpredictability of solar power. The intermittent, chaotic, and random quality of solar energy supply has to be dealt with by some comprehensive solar forecasting technologies. Despite forecasting for the long-term, it becomes much more essential to predict short-term forecasts in minutes or even seconds prior. Because key factors such as sudden movement of the clouds, instantaneous deviation of temperature in ambiance, the increased proportion of relative humidity and uncertainty in the wind velocities, haziness, and rains cause the undesired up and down ramping rates, thereby affecting the solar power generation to a greater extent. This paper aims to acknowledge the extended stellar forecasting algorithm using artificial neural network common sensical aspect. Three layered systems have been suggested, consisting of an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer feed-forward in conjunction with back propagation. A prior 5-min te output forecast fed to the input layer to reduce the error has been introduced to have a more precise forecast. Weather remains the most vital input for the ANN type of modeling. The forecasting errors might enhance considerably, thereby affecting the solar power supply relatively due to the variations in the solar irradiations and temperature on any forecasting day. Prior approximation of stellar radiations exhibits a small amount of qualm depending upon climatic conditions such as temperature, shading conditions, soiling effects, relative humidity, etc. All these environmental factors incorporate uncertainty regarding the prediction of the output parameter. In such a case, the approximation of PV output could be much more suitable than direct solar radiation. This paper uses Gradient Descent (GD) and Levenberg Maquarndt Artificial Neural Network (LM-ANN) techniques to apply to data obtained and recorded milliseconds from a 100~W solar panel. The essential purpose of this paper is to establish a time perspective with the greatest deal for the output forecast of small solar power utilities. It has been observed that 5~ms to 12~h time perspective gives the best short- to medium-term prediction for April. A case study has been done in the Peer Panjal region. The data collected for four months with various parameters have been applied randomly as input data using GD and LM type of artificial neural network compared to actual solar energy data. The proposed ANN based algorithm has been used for unswerving petite term forecasting. The model output has been presented in root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. The results exhibit a improved concurrence between the forecasted and real models. The forecasting of solar energy and load variations assists in fulfilling the cost-effective aspects.},

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) is an increasingly significant fraction of electricity generation. Efficient management, and innovations such as short-term forecasting and machine vision, demand high-resolution geographic datasets of PV installations. However, official and public sources have notable deficiencies: spatial imprecision, gaps in coverage and lack of crucial meta data, especially for small-scale solar panel installations. We present the results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data for over 260,000 solar PV installations across the UK, covering an estimated 86\% of the capacity in the country. We focus in particular on capturing small-scale domestic solar PV, which accounts for a significant fraction of generation but was until now very poorly documented. Our dataset suggests nameplate capacities in the UK (as of September 2020) amount to a total of 10.66\,GW explicitly mapped, or 13.93\,GW when missing capacities are inferred. Our method is applied to the UK but applicable worldwide, and compatible with continual updating to track the rapid growth in PV deployment.},

  abstract = {Modeling the thermal behavior of a photovoltaic system is one step toward a better simulation of its electrical performances. In this study, a numerical model of the energy balance of a 310W photovoltaic panel is developed and used to estimate the panel’s temperature by integrating the meteorological parameters over time. The input factors are the global irradiance, wind speed, ambient temperature, ground and sky temperatures if available. The energy balance is interpreted in a probabilistic way using the Monte Carlo method which provides access to an estimation of the system temperature at any probe location. This estimation is validated using experimental data for typical days with clear, cloudy and rainy conditions. Then the model is used to determine the electrical production. Firstly, it is used for the month of June 2022 where the energy estimate is compared to the experimental measurements in Nancy (France). Secondly, the model is applied over the year 2019 for two different locations — in Nancy (France) and in Las Vegas (Nevada, USA). The results are analyzed and compared with the European photovoltaic simulation tool PVGIS. Finally, the electrical production in Nancy from 2013 to 2020 is estimated using the present model.},
